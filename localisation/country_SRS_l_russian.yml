SRS_the_general_congress:0 "The General Congress of the Skynavia SR"
SRS_the_general_congress_desc:0 "The General Congress is the governing body of Skynavia, where otherwise normal citizens from electoral constituencies all over the country are nominated by their communities as delegates, and if successfully voted in, serve roughly 4-month terms representing their constituency at the Congress. This system is democratic and open, and ensures that no individual, clique, or political faction is able to dominate Skynavian politics.\n\nThe ever-changing makeup of the Congress, and the lack of political acumen of its delegates, means that Congressional proceedings are oftentimes circuitous, as every motion and proposal is scrutinised and discussed exhaustively. This is viewed as an acceptable price to pay for the democracy and liberty of the Skynavian people."

SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf_desc:0 "The world is becoming an increasingly hostile place towards socialism. The forces of reaction, rotten and stagnant as they are, threaten to plunge the continent into warfare and chaos at the behest of the profit-motive. We must discuss the geopolitical situation at hand in order to face the impending challenges of the future."
SRS_debates_1a:0 "Социализм и Прогресс"
SRS_debates_1a_desc:0 "The Internationalists have argued for a policy of efficient and productive industrialisation. We must seek to strengthen ourselves militarily, socially, and industrially if we are to carry on the revolution and liberate the rest of Griffonia. We must not forget the reason for our exile, and so must fight to return to our homeland as liberators as soon as possible, by all means possible."
SRS_debates_1b:0 "Социализм и Земля"
SRS_debates_1b_desc:0 "The Communalists have argued for a policy of highly-restrained industrialisation, emphasising a respect for the land and its inhabitants, with strict limits on the environmental pollution and ecological devastation that inevitably follow industrialisation. After all, we live here now and so shall our children, and so we must strive to be better than the polluting capitalists down south."
SRS_debates_1c:0 "Power to the People"
SRS_debates_1c_desc:0 "In the Skynavia SR, where control over local industry is highly decentralised, standards of living vary between the Republic's different constituencies, from the urban heart of New Skynavia, to the anarcho-primitivist communes of the Hail Forest. We must make sure that such basic necessities as water and electricity are available to those communities that want them."
SRS_debates_1d:0 "The Collectivisation of Technology"
SRS_debates_1d_desc:0 "Unlike the decadent bourgeois societies of the Heartlands, Aquileia, or Wingbardy, where the rich enjoy the fruits of technological prowess whilst the poor starve in their hovels nearby, the people of Skynavia shall have equal access to whatever technological advances made by their brethren. Our technological marvels may be few, but they will serve the many, not the few."
SRS_debates_1e:0 "The Liberation of Science"
SRS_debates_1e_desc:0 "The opportunity to work towards the advancement of science should be open to all who desire it. The foundation of a People's University shall make it so that science shall no longer be confined within the realms of the bourgeoisie, the military, and the industrialists, and instead become an aspiration accessible to the inquisitive masses."
SRS_debates_2a:0 "Демократия через Централизм"
SRS_debates_2a_desc:0 "We must institute the tenets of Democratic Centralism within the USRF, where political policy is decided through universal suffrage, and the outcome of the vote is binding on all party members. We must stand in unity against factionalism in order to achieve our revolutionary aspirations."
SRS_debates_2b:0 "Демократия через Конфедерализм"
SRS_debates_2b_desc:0 "We must move past the myopic statism of authoritarian nationalism, and instead pursue a radical democracy where differing political tendencies can coexist in harmony without conflict. We reject the suppressive orthodoxy of party uniformity, organising along horizontal hierarchies where a direct democracy of the masses can thrive."
SRS_debates_2c:0 "The Charter of The Republic"
SRS_debates_2c_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the social contracts of the autonomous communes, we shall draft a constitution for our Republic to codify our libertarian and democratic ideals."
SRS_debates_2d:0 "Даровать голос массам"
SRS_debates_2d_desc:0 "The right to take part in direct democracy is already available to the Skynavian citizen, who has access to the weekly assemblies of their local People's Council. The proliferation of radio technology will make it so that everybody anywhere will be able to listen in to and indirectly partake in the meetings of the General Congress taking place in New Skynavia."
SRS_debates_2e:0 "The Democratization of Knowledge"
SRS_debates_2e_desc:0 "We must make sure that the right to a decent and comprehensive education is fulfilled for the people of Skynavia. Schools will be opened where there are none, volunteer teachers will be trained, night courses be made available to the workers, and soon education will be made accessible to all."
SRS_debates_3a:0 "The Revolution of the People"
SRS_debates_3a_desc:0 "Dogmatic party vanguardism begets authoritarianism, where the wishes of the people are subverted to the demands of psuedo-colonial interventions in foreign nations. We must not forget our responsibility to lead the people of Skynavia towards a libertarian socialist future!"
SRS_debates_3b:0 "The Internationalist Vanguard"
SRS_debates_3b_desc:0 "To indulge in societal experimentation at home whilst our brothers and sisters suffer under the capitalist yoke is the highest form of self-indulgent decadence. We have a responsibility to liberate our kin in the name of socialism, and must act accordingly!"
SRS_debates_3c:0 "Перманентная революция"
SRS_debates_3c_desc:0 "Both sides of the USRF agree on the need for a so-called 'Permanent Revolution', but what this actually entails is up for debate. It is time for the Front to decide what to make of its namesake."
SRS_debates_3d:0 "The Machinery of Socialism"
SRS_debates_3d_desc:0 "The Internationalists contend that the focus of our industry should be geared towards the provision of armaments for the international socialist revolution, whilst the Communalists insist on first improving the standard of living at home. We shall put this to a vote at the General Congress."
SRS_debates_3e:0 "The Harbingers of Revolution"

SRS_war_tree_desc:0 "Right on our doorstep are the feudalistic Northern Tribes, who have warred against us since the foundation of the Skynavia SR, and incessant petty skirmishes on the border continued to claim the lives of our brave fighters.

SRS_military_5:0 "Централизованная командная структура"

SRS_elections_timer:0 "§HThe Triannual Elections§!"
SRS_elections_timer_desc:0 "Three times each year, free elections are held where the citizens of the Skynavian SR choose a delegate from their midst to represent their community at the General Congress of the USRF. These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affected by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhemling majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."

SRS_approach_tingkau_exiles_desc:0 "The deepwater harbour of Dinkau was first occupied by Imperial sailors whose ships had stopped at the harbour seeking refuge from a storm. The harbour's desirable location at the mouth of the Skynavia rier delta led to the creation of an Imperial naval outpost there, which gradually attracted settlement from adventurers, resource prospectors, and all sorts of exiles from the Empire.\n\nThe naval outpost was deserted when the Empire collapsed, but there remains a significant settler community at Dinkau that has remained aloof from the governance of the Skynavia SR.\n\nIt is time to seek rapprochement with the people of Dinkau, who lead lives of unnecessary hardship, cut off from the solidarity, good-will, and mutual aid networks of the Skynavian communes."

Populated with agrarian socialists, anarchists, radical libertarians, former ecoteurs, and the like, these communes are the epitome of decentralised and nonhierarchical society.\n\nRegrettably, their combined resources and expertise are unavilable to the rest of the Skynavia SR due to their aloof isolation from the Republic, but they should be receptive towards occasional requests for temporary collaborative efforts."

SRS_form_the_free_womens_corps_desc:0 "The social emancipation allowed by socialism demands the liberation of the marginalised on all fronts. One aspect of such liberation is that of the female gender, who have historically bore the brunt of patriarchal misogyny.\n\nBy creating an independent corps exclusive to female citizens, we will hopefully be able to empower them to fight for the liberation of their sex at home and abroad.\n\nThe Internationalists have criticised this decision as the exacerbation of identity politics, but you can't please everyone..."
