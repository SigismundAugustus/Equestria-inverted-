[h1]🏞 Brothers' Feud 1.3.5 🏞[/h1]

North of Equestria, north of the cold Crystal Empire even, lies the ancient homeland of the Yaks. These traditionalist beings have managed to maintain relative isolation and independence from the encroaching powers beyond the mountains. However, Yakyakistan was once an empire stretching beyond its current borders. Now, even what is left of the country has divided, rallying behind two opposing princes, Rutherford and Bradford, each claiming to be the best leader for all Yaks, or Jaks, as Bradford prefers to call them. Far away from the peaceful ponies of Equestria, a battle of brothers is brewing…

While the Yaks concern themselves with land warfare, the rest of the races know the truth; Power is Sea Power. The Equestrian Royal Navy has protected the Ocean Blue for many centuries, sailing between the continents to escort Her Majesty’s many merchant vessels. The Changelings, ever inventive in their lust for revenge, seek new ways to break the Equestrian hegemony without running out of the black gold required to run their panzers. While in Griffonia, the memory of the Imperial Standard flying over her proud battleships is but a distant memory. 

This is, however, but one of many scenarios which might happen in our world. Historians have asked themselves time and time again: What if the Idol of Boreas was never lost? What if the ancient dreaded fortress of Magehold was infused with powers more ruinous than ever before, and her necromancers would threaten all living beings? Perhaps, we can find out…
