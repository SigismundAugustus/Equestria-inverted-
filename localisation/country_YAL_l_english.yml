 #Focuses#
 ###INDUSTRY###
 YAL_subsidize_industry:0 "Subsidise Industry"
 YAL_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "Although some of our more radical economists despise any government interference into the economy, analyses have shown that there is much to gain from subsidising our industries. A few key investments will give us the opportunity to innovate new production methods that will give our factories an advantage over foreign competitors."

 YAL_yale_factories:0 "Revitalise Yale"
 YAL_yale_factories_desc:0 "Yale, the old capital and namesake of our country has slowly but surely been eclipsed by Greenback as the heart of [YAL.GetNameDef]. However, the city lays at a strategic location for trade within the region and still has room to grow its industry. An investment in Yale now could see the city regain some of its former splendour."

 YAL_greenback_factories:0 "Invest in the Capital"
 YAL_greenback_factories_desc:0 "Greenback has been the throbbing heart of [YAL.GetNameDef] since the industrial revolution kicked off. Many of the old cities in Griffonia grew decadent and new centres of industry and culture took their place. With the city already being the home of our most important companies, we ought to incentivise them to expand their production in the city."

 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks:0 "Ironworks in Yale"
 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks_desc:0 "Yale’s industry is experiencing a healthy growth now and those new factories are creating their own demands. Steel is the key to keep our heavy industry working and it would be prudent to create ironworks on site. A steady supply of iron is sure to make the city even more industrious."

 YAL_tungsten_production:0 "Open the Tungsten Mine"
 YAL_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Tungsten is usually mined in small underground extraction sites. However, an open tungsten mine would mean a way higher yield of this strategically important material, seeing as shells made from this material are essential for modern artillery pieces. Sure, this won’t be pretty to look at, but the locals will surely be swayed by more jobs. "

 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks:0 "Greenback Steel"
 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks_desc:0 "Weapons, cars and many other goods are made from steel. We are lucky enough to have enough mines within our borders to supply us with the necessary ores. However, our steel output can be raised even higher by funding another steel mill in the capital."

 YAL_aluminium_production:0 "Secure Aluminium Production"
 YAL_aluminium_production_desc:0 "Although steel keeps heavy industry turning, aluminium is needed for some high-tech goods like planes. By investing in aluminium production alongside our steel production, our industry will be ready for the demands of the future."

 YAL_yale_infrastructure:0 "Highways to Yale"
 YAL_yale_infrastructure_desc:0 "Yale’s infrastructure has been neglected for years, since the area lacked the heavy industrial traffic of Greenback. It is imperative that Yale gets properly integrated into our transportation network, so that the southwest will also be open for future industrial development."

 YAL_frontline_infrastructure:0 "Rails to the North"
 YAL_frontline_infrastructure_desc:0 "Most of the trade to Griffenheim has happened via river, which meant the cities in the north of the country missed out on vital investments into highways and railroads. With the Empire growing ever more volatile, it may be strategic and not economic interests that get us to finally properly connect the north to the capital."

 YAL_greenback_infrastructure:0 "Station One"
 YAL_greenback_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our rail network has been planned from Greenback since the first rails were laid down. The station building, a masterpiece of late-imperial architecture in the capital, aptly called Station One by those griffons who work on the railways is the hub for goods and passenger transport. It is time to double down and expand Station One with new platforms and warehouses."

 ###Society### 
 YAL_educational_effort:0 "Modernise the Curriculum"
 YAL_educational_effort_desc:0 "The speed at which science advances is growing ever faster, leaving griffons in more unfortunate countries behind. However, the universities must keep a steady flow of students coming from the younger generations. To give them the highest chance to succeed in higher education, we must update the curriculum so that the pupils aren’t taught outdated knowledges and refuted theories."

 YAL_bank_reform:0 "Revise the Banking Law"
 YAL_bank_reform_desc:0 "Banking is a time-honoured tradition in all of the Herzland, but the laws that govern these bankers are opaque by design. We will have our most senior law professors write a new Banking Law, one that favours our country over these transnationally operating bankers. Even laissez-faire economists agree that the law should guard against perverse incentives as to make the economy shock-resistant."

 YAL_public_schools:0 "Refurbish the Public Schools"
 YAL_public_schools_desc:0 "With most of the education budget going to universities, our public schools have been chronically underfunded. They require everything, new classrooms, textbooks and even functioning heating so that our young ones don’t have to sit in class with two winter coats on. We shall provide for our future talent!"

 YAL_land_reform:0 "Land Consolidation"
 YAL_land_reform_desc:0 "The age of feudalism has left its mark on our country as it has on most of Griffonia. Marriages, ancient contracts and feuds have made the countryside a confusing patchwork of farms and fields owned by small farmers and big estates. By encouraging land consolidation, where farmers trade their lands to make more efficient and larger fields, our agriculture will flourish."

 YAL_agricultural_studies:0 "The Science of Agriculture"
 YAL_agricultural_studies_desc:0 "Agricultural Studies is not the most prestigious field of science, but the field is rapidly developing. Rational management theories and advances in biology and organic chemistry, along with mechanised tools are paramount to increase food production. Let us remember that food surplus has been the engine of growth for civilisations since the dawn of time."

 YAL_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
 YAL_universal_education_desc:0 "Not every griffon in our country has the intrinsic motivation that draws so many of our people to the pursuit of knowledge. In fact, a lot of griffons in the countryside refuse to send their chicks to school, preferring that they work on the land. Mandatory education is a necessary change, which will make sure that every talented griffon makes its way into the hallowed halls of our university!"

 YAL_gold_standard:0 "Embrace the Gold Standard"
 YAL_gold_standard_desc:0 "When the Empire ruled Griffonia, there was no doubt about the stability of its currency. Now that the ironclad faith in Griffenheim is but a footnote in the history books, we will require a new idea. By tying our currency to gold, our money will be stable, as no griffon will doubt the value of the most precious metal!"

 YAL_industrial_breakthrough:0 "Methods for a New Millennium"
 YAL_industrial_breakthrough_desc:0 "Our industry has been lagging behind academia for a while now, due to a lack of R&D investments made by our companies. If we are to move our industry to the second millennium, the state must intervene by investing in industrial modernisation. Science will make it so our factories produce more with less!"

 YAL_yale_university:0 "Expand Yale University"
 YAL_yale_university_desc:0 "Yale University is the oldest and most prestigious university in the country, but much like the city in which it stands, the institute has been overshadowed by modernity. However, its expansive library and tradition for excellence warrant another investment. We must commission an experienced architect to build a new wing for the old university, so that Yale may use it to soar to new heights!"

 YAL_focused_research:0 "The Research Focus Program"
 YAL_focused_research_desc:0 "Our laboratories, scientists and other research facilities are ready for the next step to push the boundaries of griffon knowledge. With the Research Focus Program, the government will set out a goal for a period of 200 days. In this time, all universities will focus their attention on tackling this particular area of science, as to produce immediate benefits for our people."

 YAL_the_great_yale_archives:0 "The Great Yale Archives"
 YAL_the_great_yale_archives_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff was both an architectural visionary and a griffon working to preserve our knowledge. He is responsible for many of the reforms that made Yale what it is today, but he could never see his magnum opus finished. A massive archive, housing all the world’s knowledge. The construction of this elaborate building will be a great task, but a worthy project indeed for Borean’s heirs."

 YAL_send_invitations:0 "Invite Griffonia’s Finest"
 YAL_send_invitations_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff envisioned that his archives would help build peace amongst the griffons of the continent, by becoming a meeting place of the scholarly elite and a beacon against the ignorance that in his view, led to warfare. With the archives complete, we must invite the best griffon scholars from every nation to study in the Yale Archives. May science lead to understanding between Boreas’s chosen."

 YAL_learn_from_the_past:0 "The Treasures of the Past"
 YAL_learn_from_the_past_desc:0 "Warfare, ignorance and malice has destroyed much of the knowledge of the ancient Griffonian Empire. The archives are helping historians and other researchers to piece together the knowledge of the past. Much of the ancients’ knowledge may be outdated, but sometimes they seem to be wiser than we could have ever imagined."

 ###Internal Politics###
 ##Fascism##
 YAL_gather_the_council:0 "Gather the Council"
 YAL_gather_the_council_desc:0 "With the situation in Griffenheim turning increasingly more volatile, we must gather the Council of Rectors to plan out a new course for [YAL.GetNameDef]. The death of the Emperor and the choice of a new regent has shattered what remained of imperial unity. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so perhaps it is time to listen to some of the country’s more radical minds."
