#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "Skynavian General Congress"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "The governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia since its formation, the Skynavian General Congress is made up of 80 delegates representing their respective constituencies. These delegates are nominated from amidst their communities and democratically elected to serve short terms, with each term usually being one-third of a year, and can be reelected for a maximum of three terms. Because these delegates are held responsible to represent the opinions of their constituenciesm they are subject to immediate recall and replacement if the General Congress undertakes decisions unfavourable to their constituency.\n\nThis system of governance ensures that power remains decentralised at the behest of the people by way of preventing the formation of a politican caste. Although sometimes inefficient by being staffed with amateurs at statescraft, the General Congress can proudly lay claim to being the most democratic institution in all of Griffonia, and even Equus as well."

#### IDEAS ####
#"Borne into a world wracked by war and chaos, the Griffonian Socialist Republic has weathered many trials and tribulations. With the monarchist counterrevolution, the Socialists fled northwards with their erstwhile Republican allies."
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Skynavia SR was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firsthand the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."
communalist_manufacturing:0 "Skynavian Manufacturing Cooperative"
internationalist_armaments:0 "International Revolutionary Armaments"
SRS_the_general_congress:0 "The General Congress of the Skynavia SR"
SRS_the_general_congress_desc:0 "The General Congress is the governing body of Skynavia, where otherwise normal citizens from electoral constituencies all over the country are nominated by their communities as delegates, and if successfully voted in, serve roughly 4-month terms representing their constituency at the Congress. This system is democratic and open, and ensures that no individual, clique, or political faction is able to dominate Skynavian politics.\n\nThe ever-changing makeup of the Congress, and the lack of political acumen of its delegates, means that Congressional proceedings are oftentimes circuitous, as every motion and proposal is scrutinised and discussed exhaustively. This is viewed as an acceptable price to pay for the democracy and liberty of the Skynavian people."

SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf_desc:0 "The world is becoming an increasingly hostile place towards socialism. The forces of reaction, rotten and stagnant as they are, threaten to plunge the continent into warfare and chaos at the behest of the profit-motive. We must discuss the geopolitical situation at hand in order to face the impending challenges of the future."
SRS_debates_1a:0 "Socialism and Progress"
SRS_debates_1a_desc:0 "The Internationalists have argued for a policy of efficient and productive industrialisation. We must seek to strengthen ourselves militarily, socially, and industrially if we are to carry on the revolution and liberate the rest of Griffonia. We must not forget the reason for our exile, and so must fight to return to our homeland as liberators as soon as possible, by all means possible."
SRS_debates_1b:0 "Socialism and the Earth"
SRS_debates_1b_desc:0 "The Communalists have argued for a policy of highly-restrained industrialisation, emphasising a respect for the land and its inhabitants, with strict limits on the environmental pollution and ecological devastation that inevitably follow industrialisation. After all, we live here now and so shall our children, and so we must strive to be better than the polluting capitalists down south."
SRS_debates_1c:0 "Power to the People"
SRS_debates_1c_desc:0 "In the Skynavia SR, where control over local industry is highly decentralised, standards of living vary between the Republic's different constituencies, from the urban heart of New Skynavia, to the anarcho-primitivist communes of the Hail Forest. We must make sure that such basic necessities as water and electricity are available to those communities that want them."
SRS_debates_1d:0 "The Collectivisation of Technology"
SRS_debates_1d_desc:0 "Unlike the decadent bourgeois societies of the Heartlands, Aquileia, or Wingbardy, where the rich enjoy the fruits of technological prowess whilst the poor starve in their hovels nearby, the people of Skynavia shall have equal access to whatever technological advances made by their brethren. Our technological marvels may be few, but they will serve the many, not the few."
SRS_debates_1e:0 "The Liberation of Science"
SRS_debates_1e_desc:0 "The opportunity to work towards the advancement of science should be open to all who desire it. The foundation of a People's University shall make it so that science shall no longer be confined within the realms of the bourgeoisie, the military, and the industrialists, and instead become an aspiration accessible to the inquisitive masses."
SRS_debates_2a:0 "Democracy through Centralism"
SRS_debates_2a_desc:0 "We must institute the tenets of Democratic Centralism within the USRF, where political policy is decided through universal suffrage, and the outcome of the vote is binding on all party members. We must stand in unity against factionalism in order to achieve our revolutionary aspirations."
SRS_debates_2b:0 "Democracy through Confederalism"
SRS_debates_2b_desc:0 "We must move past the myopic statism of authoritarian nationalism, and instead pursue a radical democracy where differing political tendencies can coexist in harmony without conflict. We reject the suppressive orthodoxy of party uniformity, organising along horizontal hierarchies where a direct democracy of the masses can thrive."
SRS_debates_2c:0 "The Charter of The Republic"
SRS_debates_2c_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the social contracts of the autonomous communes, we shall draft a constitution for our Republic to codify our libertarian and democratic ideals."
SRS_debates_2d:0 "Giving Voice to the Masses"
SRS_debates_2d_desc:0 "The right to take part in direct democracy is already available to the Skynavian citizen, who has access to the weekly assemblies of their local People's Council. The proliferation of radio technology will make it so that everybody anywhere will be able to listen in to and indirectly partake in the meetings of the General Congress taking place in New Skynavia."
SRS_debates_2e:0 "The Democratization of Knowledge"
SRS_debates_2e_desc:0 "We must make sure that the right to a decent and comprehensive education is fulfilled for the people of Skynavia. Schools will be opened where there are none, volunteer teachers will be trained, night courses be made available to the workers, and soon education will be made accessible to all."
SRS_debates_3a:0 "The Revolution of the People"
SRS_debates_3a_desc:0 "Dogmatic party vanguardism begets authoritarianism, where the wishes of the people are subverted to the demands of psuedo-colonial interventions in foreign nations. We must not forget our responsibility to lead the people of Skynavia towards a libertarian socialist future!"
SRS_debates_3b:0 "The Internationalist Vanguard"
SRS_debates_3b_desc:0 "To indulge in societal experimentation at home whilst our brothers and sisters suffer under the capitalist yoke is the highest form of self-indulgent decadence. We have a responsibility to liberate our kin in the name of socialism, and must act accordingly!"
SRS_debates_3c:0 "A Permanent Revolution"
SRS_debates_3c_desc:0 "Both sides of the USRF agree on the need for a so-called 'Permanent Revolution', but what this actually entails is up for debate. It is time for the Front to decide what to make of its namesake."
SRS_debates_3d:0 "The Machinery of Socialism"
SRS_debates_3d_desc:0 "The Internationalists contend that the focus of our industry should be geared towards the provision of armaments for the international socialist revolution, whilst the Communalists insist on first improving the standard of living at home. We shall put this to a vote at the General Congress."
SRS_debates_3e:0 "The Harbingers of Revolution"
SRS_debates_3e_desc:0 "We must remind the world of the incipient socialist revolution! Such a declaration will assert the prosperity of the Skynavia SR and recapitulate our solidarity with our oppressed brethren abroad." 
SRS_war_tree:0 "The War in the North"
SRS_war_tree_desc:0 "Right on our doorstep are the feudalistic Northern Tribes, who have warred against us since the foundation of the Skynavia SR, and incessant petty skirmishes on the border continued to claim the lives of our brave fighters. Something must be done to put an end to this meaningless conflict."
SRS_war_1:0 "Galvanise Our Fighters"
SRS_war_1_desc:0 "We need to rally our friends and family on the home front in order to support our fighters slugging it out with the ponies in the frozen wastes."
SRS_war_2:0 "Galvanise Our Enemies"
SRS_war_2_desc:0 "The ponies we are fighting against are members of an oppressed social group, misled into dying for their feudal overlords. We should send a delegation to try and negotiate an end to the conflict with the Northern Tribes, or failing that, instigate the tribal ponies into rebellion."
SRS_war_3:0 "Ending the Conflict"
SRS_war_3_desc:0 "The feudalistic Northern Tribe is no more. Having freed the tribesponies from their shackles, we must now allow them their freedom to rebuild and remould their society in the socialist image. Of course, we will be there to help them through this difficult transition."
SRS_war_4:0 "From the Ashes of Feudalism..."
SRS_war_4_desc:0 "We have the responsibility to share with our comrades up north all our technological prowess, so they too may benefit, as our brothers and sisters in the revolutionary cause, from the fruits of socialist progress."
SRS_war_5:0 "The Sister Republic Arises!"
SRS_war_5_desc:0 "At the culmination of a great deal of hard work, perseverance, and sacrifice, both on our part and by our pony brethren up north, we have succeeded in developing the territories of the former Northern Tribes through the doctrine of socialism. By democratic vote, the Far Northern Republic shall be established to herald a new era of socialism in the North!"
SRS_military_tree:0 "The Skynavian People's Army"
SRS_military_tree_desc:0 "That the army of Skynavia belongs to the people is indisputable. Already, the most talented commanders of our volunteer militias have developed various tactics suited for the decentralised light-infantry formations of the People's Army for guerilla fighting in arctic weather conditions."
SRS_military_1:0 "Autonomous People's Militias"
SRS_military_1_desc:0 "Further doctrinal and organisational development of the system of autonomous communal militias will best serve the interests of the Skynavian people."
SRS_military_2:0 "Proletarian Revolutionary Guard"
SRS_military_2_desc:0 "How will we be able to export the revolution when we lack the military means to do so? The Proletarian Revolutionary Guard will be formed in order to protect and advance the interests of the International Socialist Revolution, at home and abroad."
SRS_military_3:0 "Armouries of the People"
SRS_military_3_desc:0 "We must cement the control of the people over the means of self-defence, so they will be able to protect their homes against foreign invasion should the occasion arise."
SRS_military_4:0 "Popular Control of the Military"
SRS_military_4_desc:0 "The military must remain subordinate to the will of the people if the ideals of democratic socialism are to be preserved throughout all aspects of the Skynavian SR. A horizontalised command structure will be integral to preserving democracy both within and outside of the military."
SRS_military_5:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
SRS_military_5_desc:0 "Discipline is the glue that holds the military together. The militias of the communes can enjoy their autonomy, but the powers of the military high command must be strengthened if we want to fight and win in the revolutionary struggle to come."
SRS_military_a:0 "The Strong Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_a_desc:0 "The advent of armoured tank combat taking place on Equus and Griffonia heralds the beginning of a new age of warfare. The potency of this new aspect of war should not be overlooked, and hence we must pursue development immediately."
SRS_military_b:0 "The Long Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_b_desc:0 "Socialism on the High Seas! The socialist revolution shall take to the waves in order to liberate the proletariat of the nations across the ocean in Equus. More importantly, a navy allows us to keep our coastline safe and defend our home from seaborne invasion."
SRS_industry_tree:0 "Consolidate the Means of Production"
SRS_industry_tree_desc:0 "In Skynavia, there are no bosses or capitalists, and the people work for the betterment of society under no coercion or forced labour. The Means of Production are already in the hands of the proletariat, and so we can now focus on a measured and sustainable industrialisation."
SRS_industry_1:0 "Autonomous Cooperatives"
SRS_industry_1_desc:0 "The first thing we should do is to formalise the status of the many autonomous cooperatives found all across Skynavia. While the management structure, scope, and scale of these cooperatives vary greately, they are all united in their egalitarian approach to producing value out of their labour."
SRS_industry_2:0 "Independent Workers' Councils"
SRS_industry_2_desc:0 "The concept of workers' councils may be a holdover from when labour was still controlled by the capitalists, but these councils still serve an invaluable function to Skynavian democracy by allowing for an independent grassroots organisation of the masses."
SRS_industry_3:0 "By the People, For the People"
SRS_industry_3_desc:0 "There is little sense to maintain the concept of private ownership over land, considering the lack of capitalist predation on the livelihoods of the proletariat in Skynavian society. We should encourage and propagate the idea of the public's shared responsibility to maintain and make use of the land in the communities, for the common good."
SRS_industry_4:0 "Feeding the People"
SRS_industry_4_desc:0 "The icy tundras making up most of Skynavia are hardly suited to agriculture. But by working together and applying agrarian socialist concepts to the development of arable land, the spirit of solidarity and perseverance shall soon allow us to achieve a hard-earned autarky."
SRS_industry_5:0 "Educating the People"
SRS_industry_5_desc:0 "By creating a network of communal schools, forming an organisation of travelling specialists, and writing up new school curriculums that allow for greater freedom and personal development, we will soon be able to bring education to the people of Skynavia efficiently and on a large scale."
SRS_industry_a:0 "Arming the People"
SRS_industry_a_desc:0 "Attention should be paid to the construction of communal armouries and gunsmiths, so each community, collective, and commune within Skynavia will each be capable of protecting their homes themselves."
SRS_industry_b:0 "Nurturing the People"
SRS_industry_b_desc:0 "The development gap between the urbanised areas of New Skynavia and the independent communes filling up the rest of Skynavia must be addressed. Groups of volunteers from the city, bringing with them their expertise, as well as all sorts of machinery and raw material, shall pursue intensive development within the communes dotting the banks of the Skynavia river delta."
SRS_diplomacy_tree:0 "Socialism In Our Time"
SRS_diplomacy_tree_desc:0 "It is essential for all the socialist nations of the world to be united in our shared fight for the international revolution and the liberation of our oppressed comrades abroad. By sending delegates to socialist nations abroad, we will take the first step in creating the bonds of brotherhood between the free nations of the world."
SRS_diplomacy_1:0 "Our Brothers in Arms"
SRS_diplomacy_1_desc:0 "The benevolence of the monarchist rule in Vedina does not hide the fact that it is still an instrument of class oppression that has created and actively maintains an unjust status quo. We must decide now on how to intervene in Vedina to liberate its proletariat from the shackles of feudalism and monarchism."
SRS_diplomacy_2:0 "Our Comrades in Need"
SRS_diplomacy_2_desc:0 "Decades ago, we had split with the Republicans in Cloudsbury over their refusal to share power with the people they profess to be liberating. Their centralisation of power within an exclusive cadre of the military cost them the support of the people, contributing to the failure of the First Griffonian Revolution. We must reclaim the revolutionary ideal for the proletariat by bringing to heel the militaristic warlords."
SRS_diplomacy_3:0 "Internationalist Brigades"
SRS_diplomacy_3_desc:0 "Both sides of the Congress have agreed on a policy where foreign fighters for the revolutionary socialist cause are to be welcomed to the Skynavia SR as fellow comrades and brothers in arms. These volunteers will fight in our Internationalist Brigades. The first of these Brigades to be created will be the Lions of Skynavia, formed by the hardened veterans of many a socialist insurrection abroad."
SRS_diplomacy_4:0 "Friendship of Species"
SRS_diplomacy_4_desc:0 "Taking the concept of the Internationalist Brigades to the next level, we will now start recruiting revolutionaries of different races from Equus and Griffonia, allowing them to fight in specialist units that make the best out of the physiological advantages of their respective races."
SRS_diplomacy_5:0 "Welcome the Exiles"
SRS_diplomacy_5_desc:0 "Three prominent revolutionaries - Emma Goldgriff, Mikhail Beakunin, and Pierre Proudpone - once departed from the Skynavia SR a long time ago, citing the lack of action to liberate the oppressed of our neighbouring countries. Now that we have accomplished what seemed impossible a few decades ago, we can invite our exiled comrades back home."
SRS_peace_and_plenty:0 "§HThe Land of Peace And Plenty§!"
SRS_peace_and_plenty_desc:0 "With the culmination of our democratically-driven industrialisation, the Skynavia SR is slowly and surely transitioning into a socialist utopia. The internationalists and communalists may have their differences, but in the end we have learnt to work together in the spirit of true socialist solidarity and brotherhood. In Skynavia, everyone are brothers and sisters to each other in our great socialist family."
SRS_purge_1:0 "§RSocialism has Failed us§!"
SRS_purge_1_desc:0 "The failure of the socialist leadership to guide our nation through the hardships of war has left the population thoroughly disillusioned with the Republic's founding dream of a socialist utopia. This gives us breathing space to consolidate our power. However, the much of the nation's youth have only known a life under socialism, and our power grab may soon backfire if we fail to pacify the people..."

#### DECISIONS ####
SRS_political_discussion:0 "@SRS The United Socialist Revolutionary Front @SRS "
SRS_political_discussion_desc:0 "During the monarchist counterrevolution, the myriad of socialist, communist, anarchist, and other leftist tendencies that fled north to Skynavia became united under the banner of the §YUnited Socialist Revolutionary Front§!, which democratically governs the Socialist Republic of Skynavia today.\n\nWith the Skynavia SR's governing body, the §YGeneral Congress§!, split between the Internationalists and Communalists, the Front must seek to accomodate both sides of its internal divide.\n\n§RInternationalist§!

SRS_elections_timer_desc:0 "Three times each year, free elections are held where the citizens of the Skynavian SR choose a delegate from their midst to represent their community at the General Congress of the USRF. These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affected by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhemling majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."

socrep_grif_news.1.t:0 "The New Skynavia Declaration"
socrep_grif.1.t:0 "The 1007 Conference of the USRF"
socrep_grif.1.d:0 "From all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, both urban centers and rural communities, if such terms can even be used for the frozen north, they gathered. Socialists, anarchists, communists and representatives of several other, more radical or unique leftist ideologies assembled in New Skynavia.\n\nA great task awaited these revolutionaries. The world continued to plunge deeper into the cold and cruel claws of monarchism, nationalism and of course, capitalism by the day. And thus, as the world kept becoming more and more hateful towards both them and their ideology, more drastic decisions than ever had to be taken and more drastic actions performed. \n\nHowever, there were difficulties agreeing on just what needs to be done. This was nothing new as the two political factions of the Skynavian General Congress: the Communalists and the Internationalists, while eager to participate in transforming the country into a truly free and prosperous land, have had countless disagreements over how exactly such a process should be performed. That’s not even mentioning the dozens of rushed policies which resulted in dissatisfaction of the populace and previous supporters switching sides, something which led to loss of seats in the General Congress and thus the loss of the ability to implement most decisions. While the system of various checks and balances should either side from becoming completely dominant over the other, many members of both coalitions are, or at least used to be, afraid of implementing large reforms due to the potential loss of support across the populace.\n\nThough it seems that with the current Conference reaching it’s end, there has been a shift in the mentalities of both the Communalists and Internationalists. With the situation being as drastic as it is, both groups seemed to be agreeing that while their ideas might be opposed, if the republic wishes to survive these turbulent times, accommodation is the only option."

socrep_grif.2.t:0 "Socialism and the Way we Live"
socrep_grif.3.t:0 "Socialism and the Air we Breathe"
socrep_grif.3.d:0 "While the Socialist Republic of Skynavia has only existed for a few decades, one can already easily see the effects that hundreds of thousands of new inhabitants and the expansion and establishment of both new cities and centers of production had on the environment, especially the locations with most urbanization. Already there are some places with extremely fragile local ecosystems where the expansion of production facilities might lead to permanent damage. With such a crisis becoming a potential reality, the General Congress has decided that strict limitations and guidelines on how the process of industrial expansion should be performed in our country must be implemented. Furthermore this set of laws will not only limit industrialization, but will also reduce the amount of chaotic expansion that is currently happening in the few urban centers of our country. After all it’s well know, even in the Frozen North, that modern cities have an extremely negative effect on the surrounding environment.\n\nOf course some internationalists opposed such a decision, claiming that by slowing down and limiting our industrialization we are weakening ourselves and thus endangering our freedom and independence. While many share similar fears, it was decided that it’s better to risk the present than doom the future."
socrep_grif.3.a:0 "What is the point of Utopia if the future generations can’t enjoy it?"
socrep_grif.4.t:0 "Democracy, Unity, Progress"
socrep_griff.4.d:0 "While the claims of the anarchists within the communalist coalition that increased centralism, even if democratic, could very easily lead to entire groups lacking representation and the potential slow transformation of the system into a dictatorial one, were fears that many within the General Congress held themselves, it was still decided that while a direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies is a goal that should be striven towards, the current era requires as much unity between the various political groups within the country as possible. This would be extremely difficult to accomplish witha system where even the concept of a “political party” is a foreign one. Furthermore while observing other revolutionary movements and states one can clearly see that sometimes a vertical hierarchy, even if partially contradictory to the idea of true equality between all creatures, is a necessity in order to create circumstances which would lead to an utopia in the future. Thus the ideas of Democratic Centralism will be implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nHowever, like many times before, various citizens and communities believe that our policies which are meant to give them a truly stable future, are nothing more than an attempt to gain power, and thus they have chosen to change the faction which they support."
socrep_grif.5.t:0 "A Democracy of the Masses"
socrep_griff.5.d:0 "While the arguments of the few more statist leaning representatives about the potential factionalism and the weakening of the republic in the event of an even more radical variation of democracy is implemented have been quite convincing and will definitely lead to some communities joining the Internationalist side the moment the new system shows any flaws, the General Congress has decided that such risk is truly worthy as long as each and every citizen of our republic can truly represent their own interests and ideas on the political stage. Thus the system of direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies which has already been used by some communes and collectives will be adapted and encouraged on a grander scale all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nOf course, like always there are many citizens who, while previously more inclined to support the Communalist coalition, are dissatisfied with the implementation of this new system and thus have decided to support the Internationalist faction instead."
socrep_griff.5.a:0 "Finally, the masses can thrive!"
socrep_grif.6.t:0 "Socialism Belongs to All"
socrep_grif.6.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical communalists and anarchists, the General Congress has decided that if we wish to achieve the true socialist goal of world revolution, some compromises need to be made. Our citizens already posses freedoms which millions of workers and serfs enslaved by the bourgeoisie and tyrants to the south do not. Thus, with our position of power, it is our duty to bring liberty and freedom to those who are suffering from oppression across Griffonia and the world, even if we have to employ some measures which our opposition claims are authoritarian or statist. After all, if we wish to create an army strong enough for these wars of liberation and effectively work together with any other socialist states we will need a more centralized government, an internationalist vanguard around which a liberation of all workers can be organized.\n\nHowever, it seems that our decision to begin preparing for the upcoming world revolution has led to some communities which previously supported us loosing their faith in our goals as their freedoms, which they seem to have greatly appreciated, were limited by our decision to increase the size of our army and give more power to a central authority."
socrep_grif.6.a:0 "Another step towards worker's liberation!"
socrep_grif.7.t:0 "Socialism Belongs to The People"
socrep_grif.7.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical internationalists and vanguardists, the General Congress has decided that in order to create a truly free and prosperous society, an even more anti-statist stance needs to be taken. While our citizens already posses far more social and political freedoms than the oppressed workers and serfs of the tyrannies to the south, that is true, just being better than the worst is not a motivation to stop in our march towards a Libertarian Socialist Utopia. This is why the internationalists, while clearly motivated by the noble wish to liberate the millions of subjugated griffons who slave away, are clearly misguided. After all, how can we bring true liberty to the workers of the world if we ourselves don’t truly follow our ideals?\n\nThus with this new stance taken, our republic will be even further decentralized, with the various communes and collectives receiving far more power in solving various local problems and enacting regional policies. Furthermore this will allow these local organizations to increase the size of the regional militias which will allow both these collectives and our republic to organize a better defense against any possible enemies."

However our, the communalist coalitions, understanding of what is this “Permanent Revolution” entails is completely different from the Internationalist one. A “Permanent Revolution” is the eternal advancement of society and science in order to create the true libertarian socialist utopia!

However, while our more idealistic counterparts within the opposing coalition claim that a “Permanent Revolution” is the eternal march of socialist scientific and societal advancement, their utopian fantasies do not truly match reality. No, a “Permanent Revolution” is the eternal struggle or, as some would even call, the eternal war of socialism against the tyranny and oppression of the working class across the world!

However, as most of the country is comprised of frozen tundra, both communication between the various communities and enacting country-wide policies used to be difficult tasks. However the spreading of radio technology across the country, assisted by the central leadership, has allowed us to eliminate this problem as now every community can properly communicate with New Skynavia. This also allows the People’s Councils indirectly participate in making laws and enacting policies as they can now listen to how the General Council comes to it’s decisions and how they are justified. One could claim that the entire populace of Socialist Republic of Skynavia is directly present at the debates which determine the future of the country.\n\nProviding every community with at least one radio has also created opportunities which weren’t even thought about when the policy was being enacted. The most notable of these applications is using this new network which connects the entire country in order to improve the education of chicks and foals that live in the more remote regions."
