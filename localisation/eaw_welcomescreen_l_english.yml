 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of five races - §Ypony§!, §Ychangeling§!, §Ygriffon§!, §Ydeer§! and §YUnspecified§! (with more races planned). Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the §YChangeling-Olenian Commonwealth§!).\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 15% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! includes a small number of new musical tracks. In order to allow the players to choose what kind of music they prefer, we have implemented a button in the §Ymusic player window§! (accessed by clicking the §Ynote symbol§! below §Ytime speed controls§!, and then the §Yleftmost button§!) allowing to choose between §Yboth Vanilla and EaW music§!, §Yonly Vanilla music§! and §Yonly EaW music§!.\n\nThe optional, but recommended £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War Music Mod§! supports this feature as well.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect.\n\n\n\nSince 1.6 Ironclad update, new Game Rules for various countries and game setups have been added, to allow the player to customize their £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! experience."

 # Regions
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The Northern parts of Equus are dominated by cold temperatures and mountainous terrain. Because of this, the region suffers from a debilitating lack of §YInfrastructure§!, making logistics a challenging task.\n\nThe countries in the North of Equus are notably a lot weaker than their neighbours to the South. As such, northern nations require a substantial amount of buildup and time to launch a successful attack on the south.\n\nPolitically and economically, §YNova Griffonia§! starts out as the strongest nation in the North, though it is not quite a regional hegemon, and can be overpowered by other nations, depending on the choices made during the game.\n\nThe North has to worry most about their neighbours to the south, mainly §YStalliongrad§!, the §YChangelings§! and §YEquestria§!. Seeing as how the North lacks infrastructure and industrial capacity in comparison to the southern nations, they are very vulnerable to attacks from their more powerful neighbours. That said, the mountainous and harsh terrain of the North does favor the defender.\n\nThe North offers a region with challenging terrain and tough starting conditions, and one must bide their time and exploit their neighbours to make further expansion outside the region possible."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria:0 "Southern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria_desc:0 "Southern Equus features a variety of different landscapes, ranging from mountain chains and jungles to snowy forests and flat grassland. Due to the varying sorts of terrain, the level of §YInfrastructure§! can vary a lot between different states. This region also features a long coastline, most of which is controlled by §YEquestria§! at the start of the game.\n\nMost southern nations start the game with a relatively large amount of divisions and/or industry. This makes them big threats to outsiders, though the political landscape of most countries prevents them from breaching out into different regions of the world for a long time.\n\nPolitically, this region is largely dominated by §YEquestria§!, which has the possibility of exerting further influence if they so choose. §YEquestria§! starts out as a disarmed nation, unlike their main rival and opponent, §YThe Changeling Lands§!. They, unlike their Harmonic neighbour, start out with a bigger and more capable army, and aren't as peace-loving either. It is noteworthy that this region usually grows with tension, until §YThe Changelings§! declare war on their rival, as part of §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nThe usual strategy of most countries in this region revolves around a massive industrial and military buildup during the early game, resulting in a great, region-wide war during the midgame, and finally ending in the victory of one side, who will then be in a prime position for global supremacy. Generally speaking, if one wishes to compete in this struggle for power, they would need to be on the winning side during §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nEquestria features a large variety of terrain with varying levels of §YInfrastructure§!, and features some of the most powerful nations in the world. The gameplay is largely based around the central conflict between §YEquestria§! and §YThe Changeling Lands§!, which most of this region will be involved in."
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia:0 "Northern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Northern Griffonia is a mixture of flatland and mountains, with a very low level of §YInfrastructure§! and industrial development. The terrain, low §YInfrastructure§! and harsh weather can make it a challenge to supply your troops efficiently.\n\nThe North of Griffonia features nations with a generally low level of industrial capacity and development. As such, they have a very hard time expanding beyond the borders of their own region, and require a lot of time to build up and eat up other, smaller nations around them. Nations to the East or South could, if they so wished, easily overpower any of the northern nations through industrial and military might, something that northern nations have a hard time catching up on.\n\nThe strongest nation in northern Griffonia is §YThe Griffonian Republic§!, which starts with the most units and strongest industry of the North. However, they usually do not pose a threat to any of the other northern nations due to internal struggles and problems. As such, smaller nations can attempt to conquer smaller, weaker ones without intervention. However, they must do so quickly and prepare a solid defense, because their time is limited.\n\nThe North of Griffonia will see itself invaded throughout the early midgame by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They will be among the first to be targeted by §Ythe Empire§!, and as such do not have as much time to build up and grow stronger as other nations in different regions of Griffonia. Because of this, the North usually stands a very poor chance of defeating the Empire, and it requires a lot of skill (and a fair bit of convenient luck) to defeat the behemoth that is §YThe Griffonian Empire§!.\n\nThe North is a relatively empty, undeveloped chain of mountains, hills and flatland that lacks noteworthy industry. You are very weak at the start of the game, and must acquire strength quickly to avoid conquest through the claws of §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia:0 "Central Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia_desc:0 "Central Griffonia encompasses relatively flat grassland, but also incorporates some small mountain ranges. The Region has a varying amount §YInfrastructure§!.\n\nCentral Griffonia starts out as a disunified cluster of nations, all having a small to decent industrial base. It is noteworthy that §YThe Griffonian Empire§! starts the game with several vassals under their control, and will be busy conquering these vassals to eventually become a strong industrial and military might on the Continent.\n\nCentral Griffonia is, in almost every way, dominated by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They start the game with several vassals under their control, most of which will eventually leave them. The Empire can quickly reclaim and conquer these vassals, however, only to unify most of Central Griffonia and become a powerhouse industrially and militarilly. As a vassal of the Empire, it is hard to avoid being crushed by §Ythe Empire§!, though as other nations in Central Griffonia, you are given until the midgame to prepare for an invasion by them.\n\nThe generally flat terrain and good infrastructure of Central Griffonia provides a great spot for military expansion. However, nations will find themselves at great risk, seeing as how they are dangerously close to §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia:0 "Eastern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Eastern Griffonia features a large variety of terrain, ranging from long, deep rivers and grassland, all the way to mountains and forests. The region features moderately developed §YInfrastructure§!, most of the time, though this can vary from one country to another.\n\nThe East features a relatively small industry at the start of the game but can build up a decent one throughout the game, which aids with further expansion and conquest.\n\nThe East has two big contenders for power, one being §YThe Griffon Liberation Army§!, which is located further to the south and can grow very rapidly through Conquest. The other big political instance is §Ythe River Coalition§!, a loose net of pony nations that aim to protect against outside threats, mainly the griffons and particularly the Empire. Throughout the game, various nations inside §Ythe Coalition§! will strive towards unifying into a single nationstate under their control, and any other surrounding nation would be best of with preventing this, as a unified Federation can easily overpower most neighbouring nations.\n\nThe East, due to the deterrence from §YThe River Federation§!, finds itself largely protected from outside threats, even from the §YGriffonian Empire§!. This offers much needed safety to eastern nations, giving them extra time to build up and acquire territory.\n\nEastern Griffonia encompasses long mountain ranges, deep rivers, and flat grassland, and offers a safe haven from §YThe Griffonian Empire§! and other griffon invaders, resulting in a sometimes more relaxed, definitely not peaceful playthrough. The ultimate goal of the East is to either prevent or strive for the unification of the River Federation, depending on their choice of nation."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia:0 "Southern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Southern Griffonia encompasses a variety of terrain, mainly flatland to west and more mountainous areas to the east of the region. Due to this, this region is inherently split in half with Infrastructure levels. Countries in the Southwest of Griffonia, like §YWingbardy§! have a much higher Infrastructure level and easier time to supply troops than the nations to the Southeast within the mountains, like §YSicameon§!. This regions offers access to the Sea, though very few nations possess a capable Navy at game start.\n\nThe South features a moderate amount of Industry. Rapid industrialisation can give a nation the edge it needs over less developed neighbours in order to defeat them.\n\nThe South is politically and militarilly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Wingbardy§! at the start of the game. They feature a much stronger Industry than any other southern nation, as well as a very strong military. In addition to this, they are the Leader of a powerful faction, the 'Karthinian Pact', which can act as a roadblock for smaller nations trying to grow in power within the region. §YWingbardy§! typically chooses a radical political path, such as fascism, and you should thus expect them to be wanting to expand and, at worst, wanting to kill you. A good defense against them is thus a good recommendation.\n\n§YThe Commonwealth of New Mareland§! is also a noteworthy mention for this region, as they are the second most developed nation in this Region and are a subject of the major power of §YEquestria§!. Due to this, attacking them can be very dangerous, though if they decide to strive for independence, they can end up very vulnerable.\n\nWith the start of the lategame, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will most likely be knocking on the door of the South, ready to conquer the entire Region. As a nation in the South, it is ultimately your task to survive this onslaught and defeat the Empire, though this is very challenging indeed, seeing as how §YThe Empire§! will have incorporated most of its territories back into its realm by the time they strike the South.\n\nThe mix of flat and mountainous terrain in the south makes it a moderately difficult area to traverse, while nations like §YWingbardy§! and, ultimately, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will attempt to wreak havoc in the region. A nation must play their cards right in order to successfully expand without walking into certain doom."
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia:0 "Western Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia_desc:0 "Western Griffonia is a mostly flat and hilly region, with very few mountains. Despite this, the infrastructure across the region can vary largely, though it is usually at a moderate level. This region offers access to sea and houses a great naval power, §YThe Skyfall Trade Federation§!.\n\nThe Industrial capacities of the various nations in the west vary, though they usually feature at least a moderate, if not good industrial power. With these varying levels of infrastructure, it is an easy task for the stronger nations to eat up smaller, weaker ones before dealing with more dangerous enemies.\n\nWestern Griffonia is visibly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Aquileia§! and its various vassals. It incorporates a good, strong early-game industry with a healthy amount of divisions. Due to this, §YAquileia§! could easily overrun smaller opponents. However, their political choices might distract them for long enough to keep yourself as a smaller nation and acquire more strength in the meantime.\n\nThrough the midgame, western Griffonia will be put to the ultimate test, as §YThe Griffonian Empire§! makes it way to reclaim its former territories, which includes all of the West. A Player will find that even a strong Aquileia will usually end up crushed under the Empire's hell, leaving the rest of the Region ripe for the taking.\n\nThe flat and hilly landscape of the West, combined with the decent amount of Infrastructure provide nations with the terrain that they need to wage quick wars and supply troops. §YAquileia§! is the regional power that one would need to protect themselves against, but in order to last throughout the midgame, a nation has to prepare and defend against §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. The West offers you a challenging experience, and a race against time."

The knights however, know better. After the fall of the Empire of Undeath, §Ythe Dread League§! endures on the fringes of society. The ancient dark magic of the world will always tempt the curious, as they have now.\n\nAn evil unknown calling has brought together necromancers from across the globe to the very spot where the Empire of Undeath was defeated long ago, the frozen north.

Large armies of undead cadavers in tow, they nearly overwhelmed the the lands now known as §Ythe Arcturian Order§!.

 EAW_WS_EQC:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - Friends Across the Sea"
 EAW_WS_EQC_desc:0 "Over 400 years ago the first pony traders lead by Coltlumbus settled on the coast of Southern Griffonia and founded the colony of Celestia. Since then, years of immigration, colonisation and one-sided trade deals have resulted in the §YCommonwealth of New Mareland§!. A beacon of Equestria on Griffonian shores.\n\nWhile nominally still part of §YEquestria§!, New Mareland has its own government in the Commonwealth Congress and is subject to its own laws and regulations. The lax regulations in industry and employment laws, along with the valuable griffon market, lead to many Equestrian businesses setting up in New Mareland.\n\nHowever, on the 29th October 999, the New Manehattan stock market crashed. In what has become known as §RBlack Wednesday§!, thousands of New Marelanders suddenly found themselves without a job and the nation's economy fell into turmoil. Many New Marelanders turned to Equestria for help, but the homeland did little to help alleviate their problems.\n\nMany New Marelanders, now feeling abandoned by §YPrincess Celestia§!, have begun campaigning for the Commonwealth to seek full independence. This is championed by several charismatic ponies such as §YGladmane§!, §YKingfisher§! and §YDuke Haygle§!. However, the newly appointed Governor-General §YJet Set§! still maintains a solid powerbase in the Commonwelth Congress and popular support amoung the ponies of New Mareland.

While many have their own ideas on how New Mareland should recover, some are more extreme than the others. New Mareland is also a §Ypeaceful nation§!. If faced by a war the population will need to be rallied behind the cause, there is also a sizable §Ygriffon minority§! in the nation who will fiercely reject any idea of fighting in a \"pony's\" war. However, New Mareland starts with a strong industrial base, particularly in its aviation industry.

The griffon knights of §RHellquill§! broke into the Mountain, sacking the capital and flying off with almost all the treasure of the Kingdom. Ever since, the dogs hunger for revenge.\n\nNow, under the reign of Tug’s son, §YRover Diamondshield§!, the Mountain Kingdom is finally regaining its former glory, gem by gem. The dogs have aligned themselves with the ponies of the §GRiver Coalition§! against the threat of the griffons to the west. However, if the dogs are to fight the knights, much remains to be done. Firstly, the revolting slaves have to be brought back in line. A new book has been circulating amongst them and the slaves now scream a new word; §R‘Revolution’§!. How these revolutionaries are dealt with might well shape the course of the Kingdom. Although the King simply wishes to crush them, his daughter, §GPrincess Molly§!, quietly hopes for a calmer approach.\n\nIndustrially, there is still much catching up to do for the Diamond Dogs, but with the §Gvast resources§! locked away in their realm, the dogs have but to seize their potential.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the monuments to Rover Diamondshield will say about him. Will the King reclaim his father’s wealth, will the Mountain Kingdom succumb to internal struggles or will a new power seize control of the riches underneath Diamond Mountain?"
 EAW_WS_ZES:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Zebra Colony"
 EAW_WS_ZES_desc:0 "§YNyumba ya Kaskazini§! started out many decades ago as a lowly colony of the §YZebrican Empire§!. Years of neglect and lack of profits from the colony slowly turned it to ruin, until the great pirate §YShomari Hamad§! came to the small port town of Nyumbampya and started the slave trade there.\n\nEver since then, the colony has grown into it's own independent nation, left to it's own devices by the Zebrican Empire. The current ruler of Nyumba ya Kaskazini is §YKhalfani§!, a middle aged zebra who's service to the nation has been rather dull.\n\nBut, not everything about his reign has been boring, as whispers of one of the largest raids yet have been planned. Some say the raid will be on the §RCoalition§!, others say it could be a raid on the prosperous §RMinotaurs§! to the west.\n\nRegardless of what it truly is, Nyumba ya Kaskazini is finally going to be more than a lowly colony."
 EAW_WS_NIM:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Martial Democracy"
 EAW_WS_NIM_desc:0 "The mountainous coastline which marks the eastern boundary of the River Coalition harbours but little room for pony settlement. The many myths and legends which surround the founding of Nimbusia’s first cities tell the same narrative of how the area got settled anyway. The ponies that came to the Riverlands from the north were divided by their tribe; earth pony, pegasus or unicorn. The rugged mountains of Nimbusia were left for the pegasi guardians of the expedition, as they would be easily able to settle the area which was hard to traverse on hoof. Only later did the other tribes make their way into Nimbusia, but this initial divide has left its mark on Nimbusian society today. Initially many disconnected cities, or poleis, dotted the country, but the ponies from §GNimbusi§!, the largest polis, managed to subjugate the other cities with their §Ydisciplined pegasi army.§! Combining discipline instilled from youth and an almost complete lack of ground units, this Nimbusian army has been the marvel of East-Griffonia ever since.\n\nNimbusian society became highly stratified, with many non-pegasi being relegated to the §RHelot class§!, a group barely treated better than slaves - despite the Nimbusians claiming it's just payment for protection from outside threats. These Helots were mostly from conquered cities, the defeat of their ancestors still haunting them today. They, and the non-citizen §YPerioikoi class§! stuck in the middle, were needed to sustain the martial lifestyle of the §Gcitizen-warrior class§! at the top. Although they were, in ancient times, briefly subjugated by §YPrince Blessed Sword§! of what is now called Lake City, the citizens of Nimbusia determine their own fate, voting on laws and other issues in the Assembly of Nimbusi called §Gthe Ecclesia§!.\n\nEven in the modern day, the citizens of Nimbusi see themselves as protectors of not only the Helots, but also of all the Riverponies. The pegasi fondly think back of great deeds such as §GThe Battle of Thermoponylae§!, a glorious final stand where a Nimbusian phalanx stalled the advancing griffons of the west for days, so that the rest of the Riverlands could rally. However, time has not stood still outside the mountains of Nimbusia and the Oracle at Prancetras has predicted a §Rturbulent time§!.\n\nPolitical strife has almost completely stalled all politics in the ancient democracy. Three factions are vying for power. §YThe traditionalists§! seek to uphold the status quo of Nimbusian society. If they want any change at all, they want it to be built on the past and be gradual. They have rallied behind §YPegalaios§!, an old veteran, both of politics and of war. §!The reformists§! have taken inspiration from their allies in the River Coalition. They seek to modernise the economy, to emancipate the perioikoi class into the citizenry and to cooperate more closely with Nimbusia’s neighbours. Uniquely, this faction is led by a well-respected unicorn, §YMetakeros§!. Lastly, a coalition of young officers and soldiers, who call themselves §Ythe purists§!, has formed around §YAndreia§!, a young general. These soldiers have had enough of the bickering of Nimbusian democracy and seek to centralise power under the military. However, they are criticised for their complete disdain of foreigners and civilians, especially of the non-pegasus variety.\n\nIt remains to be seen which faction manages to convince the citizens of Nimbusia. The pegasi of Nimbusia are weary of anypony garnering too much popularity and every politician is taught about what happened to those with hubris, who thought they had the crowd on their hand. §RThe Nimbusians ostracised them.§! Whoever wins the political battle, however, will find perhaps the most fearsome forces of ponies on the continent at their command..."
 EAW_WS_HLQ:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - Defenders of Griffondom"
 EAW_WS_HLQ_desc:0 "When §GThe Griffonian Empire§! was still young, Emperor §YGrover II§! lead the imperial forces across the Continent, and towards the East. The vile §Rponies§! to the East united within a Coalition to defend against the Empire, and the advance was halted.\n\nTo secure the Empire from Pony aggression, §Ythe Knightly Order of Hellquill§!, previously an independent chapter of Knights, was officially incorporated into the Empire as a March. Our honourable ancestors swore an oath to Grover II that they and their successors would do everything in their might to fight the Pony menace, and that the Empire would never have reason to fear their loyalty.\n\nMany years of honourable service to the Empire passed. Pony raids were successfully defend against, together with our Knight brethren in §YLongsword§!. Eventually, we managed to even advance all the way towards §RDiamond Mountain§! and seized their treasury. However, trouble soon loomed over the Empire, which was increasingly shaken by greed and internal conflict. Sure enough, it had soon been utterly shattered, with even Griffonstone, the home of the imperial dynasty having broken away. After all these years, years during which we fought off Pony raiders time and time again, and sought to destroy their settlements on our beloved Continent, the Empire has failed us, and is at the brink of complete collapse. As such, when §GGrover V§! was crowned in 979, we refused to renew our oaths of loyalty to the dying Empire.\n\nAnd yet, we must now ask ourselves a brand new question. With freedom from the Empire: What do we do now? Do we continue our eternal quest against Ponykind nonetheless, to make both our ancestors and gods proud? Or do we seek a new path? The future is very much uncertain to us all."
 EAW_WS_LNS:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Black Cloaks"
 EAW_WS_LNS_desc:0 "§YThe Knights of Longsword§! were formed shortly after the year 800, when §GEmperor Grover II§! of the Griffonian Empire retreated from the East, unable to conquer the Ponies living there. He formed the imperial marches of Longsword and §YHellquill§!, and gave both of the Knightly Orders the eternal quest to §Gdefend Griffondom§! from the Ponies, and to serve the Empire dutifully.\n\nHowever, despite our honourable service, the Empire succumbed to its own corruption and weakness. By the year 979, when §GGrover V§! was crowned Emperor, only the very Heartlands of the Empire still remained loyal. The Empire's reign was over, and thus our oaths of loyalty were not renewed.\n\nWithout the Empire's protection and guidance, a new group gained traction within our society. §YThe Reformisten§!, also called the 'Black Cloaks' by its enemies, is a movement of Griffon Supremacy, aiming to exert its absolute dominance over Ponykind and destroy said race to expand the living space of all Griffons. Their tenets appealed to many of the Knights and elders within society, and thus a takeover was achieved. However, after all these years of reprisals and oppressing Ponies and political opponents within the country, the voices of protest have grown louder. If we're not careful, the calls of protest could soon turn into screams of §Rrebellion§!."
