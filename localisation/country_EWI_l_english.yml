windego.2.d:0 "In the aftermath of our refusal, an envoy from the Windegos approached one of our neighbors today with the same message from the monsters, This time, their offer was accepted. Let us hope this does not give our rivals the advantage."
windego.2.a:0 "Don't see why not."

windego.3.d:0 "In the aftermath of their reappearance, we feared the worst from these so-called Windegos. Scholars are still debating about if they are the creatures of legend or merely imposters, but the fact remains that they are very powerful and deadly. After the destruction they wreaked, we feared for our safety. We need not have done so. An envoy approached our border today with a message from the monsters. They want to give us their territory as they have no use for it. It is, effectively, worthless land, but it might give us some advantage in terms of placing our troops."

POLITICS_Spectre_DESC:0 "Little is known of the Queen of the Windegos. She is said to be violent and efficient. She feeds off her captives for as long as she can, torturing them and breaking their spirits before she finally ends their lives and uses them as canon fodder for her army of zombies which supplement her Windego soldiers. She is said to have no mercy or even any regard for griffons or ponies or any race of the living besides her own. Negotiations with her will be impossible. She is hate incarnate."
