HLQ_between_giants_desc:0 "Hellquill lies at the Center of Griffonia, and forms the natural barrier between the heart of the Empire and the ponies of the East. We must under all circumstances remain neutral in order to protect both sides, and to avoid a conflict."
HLQ_the_empire:0 "The Imperials"

HLQ_industrial_revolution:0 "The Eastern Industrial Revolution"
HLQ_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Our knightly ways were never very prone to using industrial methods, and yet it is about time that we went with the time. We shall kickstart our industry, and we shall no longer be underdeveloped!"

HLQ_expand_ranks_desc:0 "There is an ever increasing need for a stronger military these days. As such, we would be best off expanding the ranks of the military. There are always more willing volunteers to be found in Hellquill, after all."

HLQ_free_transit:0 "The Neuland Act"
HLQ_free_transit_desc:0 "We can't ignore that there is still a parallel society of ponies living within our borders. This is unacceptable, to say the least.

HLQ_paramilitaries_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Our Police force is not strong enough to keep the ponies and dissidents in line. Wingfried has proposed to militarise them by turning them into paramilitary groups which any fanatic teen can apply for. This will not only show young Griffons the strength of the new Hellquill, but it will also keep the pressure on our domestic enemies."
HLQ_not_safe_at_home:0 "Organise the Geheimdienst"

HLQ_remove_the_old_guard_desc:0 "While some members of the old guard have jumped onto our movement's policies, many believe that we are simply too radical. Their opposition is a hurdle for us and Hellquill overall, and we must get rid of these troublemakers as soon as possible."

HLQ_longsword_destroy_desc:0 "Longsword has long been an ally to us, though they fail to take a more aggressive stance towards the East, like us. It's about time we absorbed them into the Hellquillian nation, so that we can fight our enemy together."

HLQ_test_subjects:0 "Group 935"
HLQ_test_subjects_desc:0 "Seeing as how ponies are nothing but rats either way, our scientists have requested to use them as test subjects for dangerous experiments. It helps our research effort and saves us a few bullets, so there is nothing speaking against it."
HLQ_beasts_of_labour:0 "Beasts of Burden"
HLQ_beasts_of_labour_desc:0 "The conquest of eastern lands means that we will occupy the lands of ponies. Obviously, it shall not remain pony land, and the ponies themselves, as the vermin that they truly are, will be turned into expendable resources of the industry. Simple workhorses for our nation. Those who cannot work will be sorted out swiftly."
HLQ_role_of_stormgriffons:0 "The Role of the Sturmgreifen"
HLQ_role_of_stormgriffons_desc:0 "There have been discussions surrounding the combat role of our Sturmgreifen brigades. We should decide on what role they play in the armed forces, an active or supportive one."

HLQ_war_industry_desc:0 "Our industry, now relatively well-developed, must be further expanded to suit our growing needs. Every aspect of our production must go towards fighting the ponies."


HLQ_industry_1:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
HLQ_industry_1_desc:0 "A new industry requires new logistical planning. We cannot rely on the old ways. That will not do the wonders of technology justice."
HLQ_industry_2:0 "The Wingenberg Coal Mines"
HLQ_industry_2_desc:0 "It's a dirty business, but industry runs on coal. We must open new mines to fuel the fires of progress. That way, we shall have enough for the production of weapons and construction of modern buildings."
HLQ_industry_5:0 "The Logging Industry"
HLQ_industry_5_desc:0 "Our natural resources are a boon handed down from above. Exploitation, some may call it, but they will not stand in the way of progress. Of course, we shall plant new trees, so that the forests may eventually regrow."
HLQ_industry_6:0 "Support Furniture Factories"
HLQ_industry_6_desc:0 "For the longest time, the cottage industry relied on individuals to provide the needs of their local towns. Moving our famed furniture production to factories will free up those workers for other purposes while still giving us valuable trade goods."
HLQ_industry_4:0 "The Hellquillian Railroad"
HLQ_industry_4_desc:0 "Our land must be brought together. What better way to do that than by providing quick and easy transport from one end to the other? A brand new railroad to connect every city and border hold in Hellquill."
HLQ_industry_7:0 "The Baubrigaden"
HLQ_industry_7_desc:0 "An army cannot move without roads and rails. A special task force whose mission is to build upon and expand our existing network will ensure that our proud troops have all the support they need in any future engagement."
HLQ_industry_8:0 "Support Local Gunsmiths"
HLQ_industry_8_desc:0 "Our nation shall be armed! Government contracts with our best gunsmiths will ensure a steady supply of weapons, as well as improve their production capabilities."
HLQ_industry_3:0 "Chromium in the Hills"
HLQ_industry_3_desc:0 "Chromium is a rare resource, and surveyors have discovered an abundance of it in the hills and mountains. A key component of heavy tanks and ships, we'd be wise to extract it from the ground. If nothing else, we'll have a new stockpile of resources to trade."
HLQ_industry_9:0 "The Wonders of Electronics"

HLQ_industry_10:0 "Science!"
HLQ_industry_10_desc:0 "With each day, the sum of our knowledge increases, yet we're still falling behind compared to the western nations. The current scientific institutes must be expanded and improved, if we wish to catch up with the world."
HLQ_industry_11:0 "Support the Silver Skies Mining Company"
HLQ_industry_11_desc:0 "The mining company of Silver Skies has discovered new, more efficient ways to mine natural resources. These new methods would prove even more effective should we lend them our hand with a sponsorship. We would do well to show him them support."
HLQ_industry_12:0 "Synthethic Oil Experiments"
HLQ_industry_12_desc:0 "The resources of our nation are, sadly, insufficient to support a proper war machine in and of themselves. However, science will rescue us once again, with synthetic rubber and oil."
HLQ_industry_13:0 "Support the Zinten University"
HLQ_industry_13_desc:0 "We have a duty to our nation to raise up the next generation of scientists and engineers. A new institution of learning, containing the latest innovations and education methods, will be a huge step towards this goal."


HLQ_army_1:0 "Army Reforms"
HLQ_army_1_desc:0 "The old ways were effective for their time, but the modern machines of the battlefield will make short work of our army if we follow them. We need new methods, new innovations, and a new chain of command."

HLQ_army_4:0 "Lightning Warfare"
HLQ_army_4_desc:0 "Speed. From the earliest era of our nation, our flying troops have been known for their speed. That has been hard to adapt to modern times, but that does not make it impossible."
HLQ_army_5:0 "Knightly Traditions"
HLQ_army_5_desc:0 "The old ways do not have to abandoned entirely. We simply have to cut out the fat and keep the trimmings. We will keep what is useful, discard the remainder."
HLQ_army_6:0 "New Artillery"
HLQ_army_6_desc:0 "Cannons that can fire over mountains, rain death from the sky, and even reshape the earth itself. That is the future of war. We shall embrace it."
HLQ_army_11:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
HLQ_army_11_desc:0 "Just like a new level in a castle, an expanded military is only as good as the supports that hold it up. We must focus not only on our front line troops, but also those griffons which will ensure it fights at maximum efficiency."
HLQ_army_7:0 "Motorisation of Our Forces"
HLQ_army_7_desc:0 "In order to effectively wage a mobile war, and to supply our forces even better, we must upgrade and improve our current transportation vehicles. They'll be the key to victory, as every army runs on its supplies."

HLQ_army_9:0 "New Guns"
HLQ_army_9_desc:0 "Though the current weaponry is admirable and servicable in its own right, we must never make the mistake of becoming complacent. Progress waits for no one and we must make sure we do not fall behind."

HLQ_air_8:0 "RADAR Experiments"
HLQ_air_8_desc:0 "Our spotter network is the best we have at the moment, but the recent innovations in the area of RADAR offers to do better. Once again, we must put our faith in progress."
HLQ_air_5:0 "Heavier Fighter Models"
HLQ_air_5_desc:0 "Our current fighters are adequate, but too easily shot down. Heavier armor and bigger engines would give them more staying power. This calls for new designs, new innovations, and more progress."
HLQ_air_3:0 "Support Our Troops"
HLQ_air_3_desc:0 "Bombers are effective in blasting our foes, certainly, but their maintenance and precision leave something to be desired. A specialised variant of the fighter plane, made to support our ground forces far more effectively, will be designed and produced."
HLQ_air_10:0 "Strategic Destruction"
HLQ_air_10_desc:0 "The best way to conquer a nation is to destroy its ability to fight. New warplans, drafted to that effect, will give us the edge in any current or future conflicts."

HLQ_navy_3:0 "A Surface Fleet"
HLQ_navy_3_desc:0 "The core of any fleet is its surface fleet. Without that, we will not be able to hold any sealane or protect any convoy. This should be the Ministry of the Navy's top priority."

HLQ_navy_5:0 "A Fleet of Destroyers"
HLQ_navy_5_desc:0 "Destroyers will keep our supply lines open and stand as a barricade between our larger ships and enemy submarines. New designs will ensure we stay ahead of our enemies."

hellquill.1.t:0 "The Treasure of Diamond Mountain"
hellquill.1.d:0 "We have acquired vast riches from the Diamond Mountain provinces. This treasure is desired by many, and yet it is our choice how we wish to spend it."
hellquill.1.a:0 "Use the treasure to help the industrialisation process."
hellquill.1.b:0 "Use the treasure to attract more colonists."
hellquill.1.c:0 "Use the treasure to help modernise the army."

hellquill.2.t:0 "Siegfried's Retirement"
hellquill.2.d:0 "Grandmaster Siegfried Trappenfeld has served Hellquill well for many years, standing valiantly against both the East and the West to keep us safe. His will to lead has slowly faded over these past couple of trying years, however. Much has changed within our world and our Griffonian Continent, and Siegfried feels that he is no longer willing to lead us into this new world. The Knightly Council respected and honoured his decision greatly, though this leaves us with one big problem: a power vacuum. Who shall be our new leader? And more importantly, what will be our stance towards our enemies and our friends in this ever changing world?"
hellquill.2.a:0 "We thank you for your service."

hellquill.3.t:0 "August Takes the Helm"
hellquill.3.d:0 "August von Ortelsberg, though previously considered an outsider in the race to becoming the new head of the council, has surprisingly made it to the top, nonetheless. August managed to convince a majority of the council's members through his promises of peace and prosperity. War and rivalry, he says, have only weakened Hellquill in the past, and cost us many thousands of lives. August is also said to believe in the equality of ponies and Griffons, and he aims to establish a free and peaceful nation, which Griffons and ponies share as equals."
hellquill.3.a:0 "Let us see what he can do."

hellquill.4.t:0 "Ponies Voice Their Concerns"
hellquill.4.d:0 "Many ponies have openly voiced their concerns about griffon encroachment near their towns and villages. They feel openly endangered by living so close to Griffons, and would like to see us handle the situation."
hellquill.4.a:0 "Reassure our pony friends."

hellquill.5.t:0 "The School Debate"
hellquill.5.d:0 "There have been many debates about how our education system should integrate ponies. Progressive and liberal Griffons argue that ponies are more alike than different from us, and that a shared education system could only help our mutual understanding in the long run. The old guard and conservatives however say that ponies and Griffons do not belong together, especially not in the same classrooms. How should this situation be handled?"
hellquill.5.a:0 "There is no need for seperated schools."
hellquill.5.b:0 "Griffons and ponies each have their needs."

hellquill.6.t:0 "Black Cloak Attack"
hellquill.6.d:0 "Groups of Griffons that are said to belong to the Black Cloaks, or more formerly known as the "Reformisten", have carried out an attack on multiple pony towns last night. Travelling from town to town, they went ahead and torched every building they could find, destroy or captured food rations and shot any pony that was brave enough to oppose them. When law enforcement arrived, the raiding party was already gone, nowhere to be seen. Rumours claim that Wingfried von Katerinburg, leader of the movement, was part of these attacks himself, but no one truly knows."
hellquill.6.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

hellquill.7.t:0 "Druwi Festival"
hellquill.7.d:0 "Today our nation celebrates the Druwi Festival, an ancient tradition of the Hellquillian ponies. For a long time, this festival had to be held in secret, since many such traditions were considered illegal, at the time. This is no longer the case, however! Ponies are happy to come out of their homes and celebrate their traditions, at last!"
hellquill.7.a:0 "Swentinimai!"

hellquill.8.t:0 "Wingfried's Arrest"
hellquill.8.d:0 "Wingfried von Katerinburg was today apprehended and arrested in his home near Beakstadt. A group of officers rushed into his home and secured him before he could escape through a backdoor. With Wingfried in our captivity, we have secured the head of the disgusting Black Cloaks, at last."
hellquill.8.a:0 "Well done."

hellquill.9.t:0 "The Von Katerinburg Trial"
hellquill.9.d:0 "The Court had gathered to decide the fate of Wingfried von Katerinburg, leader of the Black Cloaks at last. The griffon in question rose up from his seat as all eyes in the room turned towards him. He looked ever so calm, and spoke out with a collected voice:\n\n"Your Honour, I wish nothing to you, your neighbour or your wife than a secure and peaceful future. All I did in my life was aimed at achieving peace for us, the Hellquillians.\nThe only thing that I realised, unlike you, is that we must fight our enemies, not invite them for dinner. Have you forgotten the past, I ask you!? Is our very nation of Hellquill not built on the very principle of standing against ponykind? Is this not the truth? If ponies are our friend and equals, then why have they willingly attacked and raided our people many times in history? Would you call those things "equals", Your Honour? Would you really?\n\nI stand on trial here today not because my motivations and ideals are wrong, but because yours are, and because they are different from them. You can silence my voice, but the people will remind you of the choices you have made, the mistakes that you have, and will make. I warn you. I warn you all. Griffons or ponies. There can only be one. I choose griffons, though I feel you are traitors to your own race."\n\nHow shall we proceed and deal with this criminal?"
hellquill.9.a:0 "Imprison him."
hellquill.9.b:0 "Exile him."
hellquill.9.c:0 "Send him to the gallows."

hellquill.10.t:0 "A New Hellquill"
hellquill.10.d:0 "Through the careful yet determined leadership of August von Ortelsberg, we have created something truly beautiful. A new Hellquill has been born, one where ponies and Griffons live together, not as enemies but as friends and as equals. And yet, while this is a great step for us all, let us march on towards the future, and secure this new Hellquill. Harmony and Friendship shall shine forever on!"
hellquill.10.a:0 "Griffons and ponies stand united!"

hellquill.11.t:0 "The Duke"
hellquill.11.d:0 "August's deeds have quickly granted him the status of a hero amongst a majority of our people, especially the ponies. Seeing as how this new Hellquill is his sole creation, we should thank him by crowning him the first Duke of Hellquill. May he remain a fair and decisive ruler, and lead us into an ever brighter future!"
hellquill.11.a:0 "Long live the Duke!"

hellquill.12.t:0 "The Republic"
hellquill.12.d:0 "August has lead us to create something greater than Hellquill has ever been: A society of equals. With this in mind, we should take the next step in assuring that Hellquill remains free and fair for all. The Republic of Hellquill shall be proclaimed!"
hellquill.12.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

hellquill.13.t:0 "The First Election"
hellquill.13.d:0 "With the founding of the Republic, elections have been called to determine who should be our future leader. There are interesting choices to pick from, including our current head of state, August. Who do the griffons and ponies of Hellquill favour the most?"
hellquill.13.a:0 "Von Ortelsberg shall remain as President."
hellquill.13.b:0 "River Breeze of the Freedom Party becomes the President."
hellquill.13.c:0 "Colonel Reiner Guttenfried is elected President."

hellquill.14.t:0 "Officers Resign"
hellquill.14.d:0 "Following the establishment of our new leadership, a group of officers has departed and resigned from their posts. We don't know their true motives behind this move, which they have made sure to keep quiet about, but it is sad to see parts of the old guard of our forces go like this."
hellquill.14.a:0 "We're sorry to see them go."

hellquill.15.t:0 "Dealing with Longsword"
hellquill.15.d:0 "Our nation has changed a lot during these past couple of months. From an ancient knightly order, we have reformed ourselves into something greater, a place where two races can cooperate and coexist with one another. Our neighbours, friends and old allies of Longsword to the south, however, have not seen reason just yet. It is time we approached them, as friends, and invited them to join us. Only through unification can we guarantee that no further blood is shed between Griffons and ponies."
hellquill.15.a:0 "Let us talk to our friends."
hellquill.15.b:0 "Sadly, blood must be shed for unification."

hellquill.16.t:0 "An Offer From Hellquill"
hellquill.16.d:0 "Our neighbours and ancient allies to the north, Hellquill, have sent us a telegram today. It attempts to charm us and portrays our alliance and friendship in great detail, but the main point of it is Unification. The Hellquillians ask for us to surrender our nation to them for peaceful unification under their banner. All our griffons (and ponies) would receive immediate citizenship and protection from Hellquill. What should our response be? Do we unite with our friends? Or is this the time to finally break ties with them?"
hellquill.16.a:0 "We shall join them in harmony."
hellquill.16.b:0 "We politely refuse."

hellquill.17.t:0 "Longsword Accepts"
hellquill.17.d:0 "Huzzah! Our friends and allies in Longsword have seen reason in our polite request and have given in to our request for unification. Henceforth, Hellquillians and Longswordians shall stand as one, together!"
hellquill.17.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.18.t:0 "Longsword Declines"
hellquill.18.d:0 "It appears that despite our best efforts and kindest words, Longsword has declined our request for unification. This is most unfortunate, and poses a dangerous question to us: Do we accept their decision? Or do we ensure lasting peace between ponies and Griffons by taking them by force?"
hellquill.18.a:0 "An unfortunate decision."
hellquill.18.b:0 "Forceful unification it is, then."

hellquill.19.t:0 "Urlach Becomes the New Grandmaster"
hellquill.19.d:0 "The Knightly Council has decided on the matter of Siegfried's succession: Urlach, yet another Knight, shall henceforth lead our Order into the future as Grandmaster! With a new, valiant Knight at the helm, our main focus shall lie in defending against the eastborn ponies, just as we have done for many hundreds of years. There are many problems that continue to plague our nation though, problems that must be addressed urgently."
hellquill.19.a:0 "Time to get to work."

hellquill.20.t:0 "The Fight Against Illiteracy"
hellquill.20.d:0 "It is time to take up arms against the ever-growing Illiteracy within Hellquill. No longer shall our chicks gasp in sorrow, unable to read even the most basic of texts. Schools, reading clubs and more, this is what we need, and this is what we shall have!"
hellquill.20.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.21.t:0 "The End of Illiteracy"
hellquill.21.d:0 "We have done it! Illiteracy is finally a thing of the past, and our griffons have become skilled at writing, reading and basic mathematics. This is a great day, indeed!"
hellquill.21.a:0 "Finally!"

hellquill.22.t:0 "The Shield of Griffonkind"
hellquill.22.d:0 "A small group of Knights from Hellquill has made their way into Griffenheim this afternoon, wanting to speak with the Imperial Regent. At their head was the Grandmaster of Hellquill, Urlach. He made an inspiring speech about our old values of honour and tradition, and then kneeled down before the regent and the rest of the imperial council, pledging renewed allegiance and servitude to the Empire. We will make sure that this act of honour is not so easily forgotten. The Knightly Order returns to protect all Griffons in the Empire!"
hellquill.22.a:0 "Welcome back!"

hellquill.23.t:0 "The Knights Demand Submission"
hellquill.23.d:0 "It seems our longtime friends in Hellquill have sent us a "request" today, or rather an ultimatum. They say that, in order to ensure continued prosperity and safety for the Empire and all Griffons, we must accept unification under their banner. We would no doubt bring shame over ourselves and our ancestors if we gave up our sovereignty just like that! And yet... we don't stand a chance against Hellquill and the Empire combined. Perhaps we should just avoid a pointless bloodshed?"
hellquill.23.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
hellquill.23.b:0 "Never! Longsword will be free!"

hellquill.24.t:0 "Longsword Refuses"
hellquill.24.d:0 "Those fools down in Longsword have unfortunately failed to see the reason in our most reasonable request for unification. Oh well. It was their choice, after all. If it is war they seek, then war they shall get!"
hellquill.24.a:0 "To war!"

hellquill.25.t:0 "Wingfried Takes Control"
hellquill.25.d:0 "The Knightly Council has discussed the future of Hellquill in depth, and one singular Griffon has come out on top of everyone else, it seems. Wingfried von Katerinburg, founder and leader of the 'Reformisten' movement, has been elected to lead Hellquill henceforth. He has vowed to act only in the interest of Hellquill and its Griffons, deliberately ignoring and leaving out that Hellquill is still home to many Pony minorities. Wingfried and his violent ideology are renown for their views on Griffon supremacy and the concept that ponies are an evil that must be eliminated for the good of Griffonkind.\n\nOne way or another, Wingfried aims to elevate Hellquill to something beyond an ordinary Order of Knights, and shape it into something greater, something that will last for a thousand years."
hellquill.25.a:0 "For glory!"

hellquill.26.t:0 "The Old Guard Complains"
hellquill.26.d:0 "The new leadership under Wingfried has started to get rolling. Some officers within the old guard have uttered increasingly vocal complains about our policies and choices of action, however. Clearly, they're not a great fan of our ideology and policies."
hellquill.26.a:0 "We don't appreciate dissenters."

hellquill.27.t:0 "Reign of Terror"
hellquill.27.d:0 "Last night, ten minutes after midnight, it commenced.\n\nThe streets were suddenly lit up with the light of torches burning bright. Rows and mobs of Griffons marched through the streets of the capital, shouting chants along the way as they made their way to the Pony ghetto at the outskirts of the city. A group of police officers, uniformed to look just like soldiers, broke open the gate to the Ghetto, which had been previously locked to disallow the ponies from leaving their 'containment zone'.\nIt was a slaughter. After just three minutes, Houses had been set ablaze, gunshots were being fired, there were brawls between the angry mob and desperate, yet brave ponies. But it was no use. At the end of the Night, just less than an hour after it all began, the Pony ghetto fell silent once more. They were dead.\n\nThis night was but start of something much greater. All across Hellquill, Griffons are encouraged to rise up into violent mobs and attack any ponies in their area. The Government has made their position more than clear: Hellquill is a home for Griffons, ONLY Griffons."
hellquill.27.a:0 "We'll get rid of the rats eventually."

hellquill.28.t:0 "Refugees in Deponya"
hellquill.28.d:0 "Today, just after dawn, large groups of exhausted and visibly scarred ponies crossed the border between Hellquill and Deponya. They seek refuge from 'the terrors of Hellquill.' Generous and helpful families have decided to allow these ponies safe refuge within their homes until the government has a place to permanently house them in, or until this situation is otherwise resolved. The question remains however: What exactly did happen in Hellquill? What are they running from? And... should we be scared, too?"
hellquill.28.a:0 "This is an ill omen."

hellquill.29.t:0 "Education Effort"
hellquill.29.d:0 "The governments of the past have been horribly neglective of educational efforts and institutions. As such, illiteracy has sky-rocketed and threatens to consume our nation. Thankfully, it is not too late, just yet. We will turn the tide in this battle against illiteracy!"
hellquill.29.a:0 "We can resolve this issue."

hellquill.30.t:0 "Education Efforts Finished"
hellquill.30.d:0 "At last, our educational efforts have shown their effect on the people, and our crisis has been overcome. The Griffons of Hellquill shall henceforth remain at the forefront of education!"
hellquill.30.a:0 "Good to hear."

hellquill.31.t:0 "The Kingdom of Hellquill"
hellquill.31.d:0 "Our great leader Wingfried has decided that today is time. This very afternoon, he assembled the government, military and the press to announce whole-heartedly to them all that Hellquill's new order will bring greatness to us and all Griffons. He proclaimed himself King of Hellquill, claiming that his crown shall remain an instrument of power for a thousand years! His subjects rejoice, and the military is eager for what is to come. Let us not waste any time: Onwards! A thousand years of glory await!"
hellquill.31.a:0 "To a thousand years!"

hellquill.32.t:0 "Role of the Sturmgreifen"
hellquill.32.d:0 "The Sturmgreifen, our new elite forces, have been a topic of debate, as of recent. There is a discussion about their precise role within the armed forces, namely an aggressive and direct role at the frontline by giving them their own regiments within the army, or a more supportive role by stationing their soldiers behind the Frontline and in recon battalions to more effectively aid our troops. Both suggestions sound reasonable, but only one is possible. Which one will it be?"
hellquill.32.a:0 "Give them their own regiments."
hellquill.32.b:0 "Give them a support role."

hellquill.33.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"
hellquill.33.d:0 "The griffons of Hellquill have approached us with a request for protection, namely a formal guarantee of independence. Our advisors are split on the matter, though Hellquill argues that their safety is in the best interest of the Empire, as well. On the other claw, protecting Hellquill means we might get dragged into a war with the entire River Coaliation. How shall we proceed?"
hellquill.33.a:0 "We shall guarantee them."
hellquill.33.b:0 "They don't deserve our protection."

hellquill.34.t:0 "The Empire Accepts"
hellquill.34.d:0 "The Empire has shown reason and accepted our request for a gurantee. Our safety should henceforth be ensured."
hellquill.34.a:0 "Hellquill is safe!"

hellquill.35.t:0 "The Empire Refuses"
hellquill.35.d:0 "Despite our best diplomatic attempts, the Imperials have refused to guarantee our Independence from any foreign force. We tried to tell them that our well-being was in their best interest, as well, but to no avail. We stand alone."
hellquill.35.a:0 "There is always next time..."

hellquill.36.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"
hellquill.36.d:0 "The griffons of Hellquill have approached us within the capital today, not to declare war (for once) but to commence diplomatic talks. It appears that they have had a huge change of heart over these last few months, resulting in a much less aggressive stance overall and the creation of a new society where ponies and griffons in Hellquill can live together in peace. Now, they seek us out for formal support and a guarantee of independence. Is this a good idea?"
hellquill.36.a:0 "We shall guarantee them."
hellquill.36.b:0 "They don't deserve our protection."

hellquill.37.t:0 "The Federation Accepts"
hellquill.37.d:0 "We've done it! The ponies of the River Federation have come to peace with us and our past, at long last. As such, they have agreed to guarantee our independence from any outside invader. This will aid our diplomatic effort towards the ponies, and protect us from any threat on the continent."
hellquill.37.a:0 "Most excellent!"

hellquill.38.t:0 "The Federation Refuses"
hellquill.38.d:0 "Unfortunately, despite our best intentions and efforts, the ponies of the River Federation have refused us and our polite request. Perhaps it was too early to attempt a rapproachment with the ponies."
hellquill.38.a:0 "There is always next time..."

hellquill.39.t:0 "Hellquillian Membership"
hellquill.39.d:0 "The Griffons of Hellquill aim to work together with us to ensure our mutual safety it seems, as they have sent a formal request to join the River Coalition. While this might seem very nice in spirit, it could also upset many other members, seeing as how the Coalition itself was founded by defending against the Griffons."
hellquill.39.a:0 "We welcome them to the Coalition."
hellquill.39.b:0 "We don't need their kind here."

hellquill.40.t:0 "Honourary Membership Granted"
hellquill.40.d:0 "Rejoice! The ponies have granted us an honourary membership as part of the Coalition. Henceforth, we shall be close allies of the ponies!"
hellquill.40.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

hellquill.41.t:0 "Honourary Membership Declined"
hellquill.41.d:0 "Black news. It appears that our best efforts have failed, and the Riverponies have refused our request to join their Coalition."
hellquill.41.a:0 "I'm sure they'll accept us eventually!"

hellquill.42.t:0 "The Purple Plague"
hellquill.42.d:0 "A great tragedy has struck us all! Thousands of ponies lie dead in the streets of our cities, and smaller villages have turned into ghost towns, inhabited only by the deceased corpses of the ponies who once prospered there.\n\nThe vile regime of Hellquill, lead by the disgusting and racist Wingfried von Katerinburg, has treated ponies like dirt before, even cutting defenceless families down with sabers in an effort to destroy the pony population of Hellquill. Now, these acts have grown too big to ignore, and too vile to tolerate.\n\nPonies in Hellquill were apprehended and experimented upon by griffon scientists. It appears that there, the scientists infected the ponies with a terrifying and deadly virus, the purple plague as it is called. Then, they sent hundreds, if not over a thousand of these infected individuals east, into our lands. Anypony that got close to them was almost doomed to die, and this disease has already killed entire countrysides and half the population of certain cities in the River Federation, with the death toll steadily increasing.\n\nWe must take action against these thugs and racists in Hellquill. We can no longer tolerate their actions, nor do we have the choice to look the other way. The Governments of the River Federation have agreed in absolute unison:\n\nWe are going to war. The Griffons will pay!"
hellquill.42.a:0 "We'll kill those conniving bastards!"

hellquill.43.t:0 "A Plea from [From.GetNameDef]"
hellquill.43.d:0 "An envoy has arrived in great haste today at the Imperial Palace, begging the Emperor and the Regent for help. After we've got the griffon to calm down and explain his issue, he has revealed that the [From.GetName] is under grave threat, and require immediate assistance lest the Empire's eastern borders become threatened. While we regard the eastern lands as our rightful territory, we might not be able to properly cover the front, given the current situation in the rest of Griffonia. How do we respond to the envoy?"
hellquill.43.a:0 "Give them aid, but demand vassalage!"
hellquill.43.b:0 "We cannot offer them help in these difficult times."

hellquill.44.t:0 "The Empire Accepts our Plea"
hellquill.44.d:0 "The Empire has decided to bring us aid in our darkest hour. While we will have to recognise their sovereignty over us, it is preferable to total destruction."
hellquill.44.a:0 "Better to live on our knees than die standing!"

hellquill.45.t:0 "The Empire Rejects our Plea"
hellquill.45.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Empire has declined to bring us aid in our darkest hour. The envoy brought the bad news while barely suppressing his tears. We are left on our own against the invader..."
hellquill.45.a:0 "Boreas, preserve us..."

hellquill.46.t:0 "The Empire Demands Submission!"
hellquill.46.d:0 "A letter has arrived today, bearing the Emperor's seal. What could prompt the Empire to turn their attention to us? A cursory reading reveals that the Empire demands their rightful vassal, the Knightly Order of Hellquill, to place themselves under the Empire's aegis, for the Riverponies have risen up in vast numbers to destroy the griffon way of life. While we've remained neutral thus far in the conflict, there's no telling when the ponies will turn their attention on ourselves. How shall respond to the Emperor?"
hellquill.46.a:0 "The ponies are a great threat, we must submit."
hellquill.46.b:0 "We can handle the ponies on our own!"

hellquill.47.t:0 "[From.GetName] Submits"
hellquill.47.d:0 "The leader of [From.GetName], [From.GetLeader] has arrived today in [Root.Capital.GetName] to swear oaths of fealty to the Emperor. Predictably, they have bowed before our might."
hellquill.47.a:0 "We welcome our new vassal."

hellquill.48.t:0 "A Diplomatic Insult!"
hellquill.48.d:0 "Outrage! [From.GetLeader], the leader of [From.GetName] has rejected our rightful demand, claiming they don't need our protection against the Riverpony extremists! They need to be taught a lesson in manners, and know to bow before their betters!"
hellquill.48.a:0 "Their lands are forfeit to us!"

hellquill_news.1.t:0 "Purple Plague Unleashed!"
hellquill_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The Kingdom of Hellquill is notorious for its rabid hatred of ponies, but most assumed they would be content after deporting them from their lands. This half truth was quickly proven deeply wrong.\nAcross the Riverlands in eastern Griffonia, ponies were falling ill to the previously extinct disease known as the Purple Plague. At first, it was believed to be an isolated outbreak, were it not for Hellquill recently proclaiming that they had brought doom upon the ponies. This vicious virus spread at an alarming rate, with a staggering death toll thus far, caused entirely by Hellquill infecting healthy ponies and sending them back to their homes.\nThe Riverponies have put aside their differences and united as one to cast down the vile regime. Unfortunately, even if they are successful, nothing will bring back thousands of ponies that are already lost."

### Leader Descriptions ###
retires_in_a_month_desc:0 "Current Grandmaster of the Hellquillian Order of Knights, Siegfried Trappenfeld has seen many battles in his lifetime, and is respected by all for his unwavering dedication, boldness and being the paradigm of a knight. His decision to cut ties with the failing Griffonian Empire was a pragmatic choice based on preserving their endless duty, the defence of the eastern borders against the pony menace. Although he is concerned about the growing extremist element in Hellquill, Siegfried remains confident that Hellquill will remain like it has always been, a bulwark to protect the griffon way of life."
griffon_hitler_desc:0 "Most griffons you'd ask wouldn't know how Wingfried von Katerinburg became so characteristically hateful of ponies. Some say it was a traumatic event early in his lifetime, others say it is a result of fighting on the borders for so long. Nevertheless, Wingfried made the complete and total ruination of the eastern Riverpony nations the key policy in the new Hellquill. With Hellquill united behind him, von Katerinburg will fight to the last breath in order to achieve his goal."
wholesome_nerd_desc:0 "Former head archivist of the Hellquillian Order, August von Ortelsberg had spent many hours documenting and researching the knightly order's history. He has repeatedly reached the conclusion that the conflict between ponies and griffons is immensely destructive and has achieved nothing positive for anygriff or pony. His continuous pleas to the Grandmaster fell on deaf ears, and when the latter stepped down, August's exasperation only grew, comprehending that his attempts to foster peace would never be realised. Thus, he was pleasantly surprised when the Knightly Council has chosen him for the new Grandmaster of the Order, and he now does his best to mend the wounded relationship between ponies and griffons, in order to create a new and harmonious Hellquill. "
siegfried_2_0_desc:0 "Urlach ap Cyrod, a veteran knight who earned his mettle from a dozen campaigns, is a staunch traditionalist and believer in the Hellquillian ideals. A natural choice for the newest Grandmaster, Urlach seeks to continue his mentor Siegfried's legacy and preserve Hellquill's role in the world. While he has some adverse views on the ponies, he is pragmatic enough to avoid antagonising them and is open to the idea of reestablishing ties with the Griffonian Empire, should there be no other choice."
fake_pants_desc:0 "River Breeze's family has lived in Hellquill all their lives, and despite the intense griffonisation they were subjected to, they never considered moving to friendlier lands. Instead, they've adopted large parts of the griffon culture, with River Breeze himself becoming a priest of Arcturius. While this wasn't the future he had in mind for himself, being pressured by his relatives, he has come to appreciate the position. Seeing the faithful griffons and ponies moved something in him, especially after prosecutions began, led by the vile Wingfried. He has repeatedly shielded his pony flock from the Reformisten, using his knowledge of the faith to shame them away, and in return, the community has rallied around him. As such, when the first elections were organised in the newly liberal Hellquill, he was a natural choice for president."
should_have_picked_ortelsberg_desc:0 "Reiner Guttenfried has had an unassuming service in the order's military, following orders to the letter, but never truly distinguishing himself. However, his claim to prominence comes from his dedication to the soldiers' wellbeing, so much that everygriff who served under him couldn't say a single disparaging word. Thus, he developed a reputation of a firm but fair commander, who would protect the pony minorities from other, more radically minded units. He was surprised to see himself winning the first elections, having campaigned only to satisfy his friends in the army, but the ponies and griffons of Hellquill have recognised the need for a character of sterner stock to lead them in these trying times."
HLQ_eisen_desc:0 "§gOriginating from Brodfeld, Eisen was born into a peasant family in 971 ALB, on the border near the Gryphian Host. He and his brother, Sycle Coroanargint, would at a young age witness a Cossack raid while on an errand near the countryside. His brother was amazed by the cossacks, and would begin to dedicate most of his free time learning about the military, art of war and politics. What Sycle didn't realise however, was that he had accidentaly neglected his younger brother, who became bitter over the lack of attention from his older brother, who he had considered a role model of sorts.\n\n To earns his brother's attention again, he joined the cossacks as a volunteer when he reached the age of 18. Over time he grew attached to the group he was travelling with, and considered them friends he never had before. But in 992 ALB, a raid on Lake City went completely wrong. The Cossacks all died during the attack, and Eisen was scared from a pony sword, his beak cracked from the impact. Suprisingly, the ponies had though him dead while he lay unconscious, and he miraculously survived.  The impact of losing the ones he held most dear broke him emotionally, and in this mentally unstable state, he begun the blame the ponies for this misfortune.\n\n Broken and angry, he returned to Brodfeld, only hear that a pony named Applethorn, a communist from Farbook, was helping the revolution in Brodfeld, his own country. Enraged, Eisen headed to inform his brother of what the ponies had done to him and his country, and that they must be punished. Sycle, understanding that the fault lied on the claws of the griffons, not the ponies, ignored his brother's ramblings, once again neglecting his already unstable younger brother. Eisen, betrayed by his own brother, became broken, without a purpose. This changed when he heard of the reformisten in Hellquill, and he begun to march north in search of them. Hearing Wingfried's speeches about "the pony menace" radicalises Eisen, and he would soon join the reformisten, changing his surname to Silberkrone. With this newfound purpose, he became a fanatic for the cause, eventually rising up the ranks of the party, finally to the leader of the Sturmgreifen.§!"
